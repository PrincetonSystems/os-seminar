Each student (or in groups) must submit a final report and
give a final presentation. You have a choice of either:

-   Writing a literature on a sub-field of systems (e.g.Â extensible
    key-value stores) that could serve as the background section.

-   A course project. Ideally this is either augments research you are
    doing anyway or an early bootstrap of a research project.

The final report should be an appropriate length to showcase your work
*succinctly*. Most reports should probably be 4-6 pages in [USENIX
conference style](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates)
excluding figures and references.
