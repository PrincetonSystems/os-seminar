Systems need to balance how much extensibility, safety, and performance they
provide applications. This is one of the fundamental trade-offs in system
design. The goal of this seminar is to make you a better systems builder, paper
reader, and systems researcher, by identifying this trade-off in various
settings and thinking of ways to subsume it.

## Deliverables

There is neither a midterm nor a final exam for this course. Instead, grades are based on participation in class discussions, reading annotations, and 

Each week we will read 2-4 papers from the systems literature. Many of these
papers are dense with information. Understanding them in depth _requires_
reading _actively_.

To facilitate engagement, you are required to make 5 substantive annotations on
each paper using Perusall by noon the day before class (you'll still be able to
respond to each other after the deadline). An annotation can be a question,
summary, or insight. You'll be able to see, and comment on, other students'
annotations. Please do so (though you are not _required_ to comment in excess
of your annotations)!

In addition, each student (or in groups) must submit a final report and
give a final presentation. You have a choice of either:

-   Writing a literature on a sub-field of systems (e.g.Â extensible
    key-value stores) that could serve as the background section.

-   A course project. Ideally this is either augments research you are
    doing anyway or an early bootstrap of a research project.

The final report should be an appropriate length to showcase your work
*succinctly*. Most reports should probably be 4-6 pages, excluding references,
in [USENIX conference
style](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates).

## Grading

-   ***30% Participation***: For each reading, you'll be asked to post
    *substantive* comments or questions using
    [Perusall](https://perusall.com). Comments and questions are due
    24-hours before the class for which the reading is assigned.

-   ***30% Attendance***: Class is only as valuable as *you* showing up!
    You have 8 "slack days" that you can use at your disposal to miss
    scheduled class without impacting your grade.

-   ***40% Final report and presentation***: You have a choice of
    submitting a final report for either a literature review or course
    project.
