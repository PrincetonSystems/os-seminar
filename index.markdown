Systems need to balance how much extensibility, safety, and performance they
provide applications. This is one of the fundamental trade-offs in system
design. The goal of this seminar is to make you a better systems builder, paper
reader, and systems researcher, by identifying this trade-off in various
settings and thinking of ways to subsume it.


## Assignments & Exams

There is neither a midterm nor a final exam for this course.

Each week we will read 1-3 papers from the systems literature. You are
required to make 5 substantive annotations on each paper using Perusall
by noon the day before class (you'll still be able to respond to each
other after the deadline. Your annotations can be questions, summaries,
or insights, but it's important to engage with the reading.

In addition, each student (or in groups) must submit a final report and
give a final presentation. You have a choice of either:

-   Writing a literature on a sub-field of systems (e.g.Â extensible
    key-value stores) that could serve as the background section.

-   A course project. Ideally this is either augments research you are
    doing anyway or an early bootstrap of a research project.

The final report should be an appropriate length to showcase your work
*succinctly*. Most reports should probably be 4-6 pages in [USENIX
conference style](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates)
excluding figures and references.

## Due Dates

### Readings

Annotations for readings in Perusall are always due noon the day before
class.

### Project or Literature Review

October 22nd - Proposal due

October 24nd - 10min Proposal presentations

January 15th (Dean's day) - Final reports due

January 14th & 16th - Final presentations (regular class times)

## Grading

-   ***30% Participation***: For each reading, you'll be asked to post
    *substantive* comments or questions using
    [Perusall](https://perusall.com). Comments and questions are due
    24-hours before the class for which the reading is assigned.

-   ***30% Attendance***: Class is only as valuable as *you* showing up!
    You have 8 "slack days" that you can use at your disposal to miss
    scheduled class without impacting your grade.

-   ***40% Final report and presentation***: You have a choice of
    submitting a final report for either a literature review or course
    project.
